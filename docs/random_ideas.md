# Turning this into a roguelite

Somewhere on the map, the Demon King has spawned and is also expanding, though much faster and with stronger units than
the player.
Eventually, they will clash. The player can attempt to fight back, but that will become gradually harder over time,
given that the increased resistance will raise the big bad's attention.

In between runs, permanent upgrades can be purchased. Higher resource production, unit buffs, new unit classes,
increased distance to the demon spawn location... Maybe allow them to take a unit from their previous run with them.

If the player eventually manages to overcome and defeat the big bad, they have an option of becoming the big bad
themselves for their next run.

## Horoscopes

A random set of Units and/or Skills will receive Buffs and Debuffs every match. These effects will last for the entirety
of the encounter.

# Basic Modding Support

By parsing all game data from external files at game launch, certain aspects like classes, skills, monsters and events
will be easy to change or extend.

# Multiplayer

- Control the same kingdom (control different groups or share units within the same fight)
- Control different kingdoms (As allies or foes)

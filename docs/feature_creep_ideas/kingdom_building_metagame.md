# Metagame â€“ Kingdom Building

In between battles, players can manage their growing empire on a hexagonal world map.

- Hexagonal World Map
- Every Tile produces Resources
- Buildings can be placed onto Tiles to increase resource production or for other effects
- Resources can be used to unlock new Skills, Equipment and Recruit new Fighters
- Player chooses one Tile to attack each round, which will initiate combat.
    - When victorious, tile will be conquered for the kingdom
- Likewise, owned Tiles will regularly be attacked by Monsters and other adversaries.
    - Players can deploy units to defend their lands, or initiate a fight themselves.

-> Start from a small settlement to a globe-spanning empire!

- Tiles owned

## Tiles and Tile Effects

- Grasslands: Food Production Bonus
- Woodlands: Timber Production Bonus
- Mountains: Metal Production Bonus
- River: Food Production Bonus, might allow special building interactions
- Ocean: Cannot be settled, natural boundary

## Resources

- Quarters: Directly limit the army size. Every Unit occupies a spot, and when this is maxed out, no more units can be
  recruited
- Food: Needed to keep your population happy
- Money: Used to hire Mercenaries

## Buildings

Buildings can be built onto Tiles to acquire extra effects, such as resource refinement or extra production.

- Smith: Builds Weapons & Armor

### Combat Preview

Tiles will show a preview of what they can expect on a tile: Monsters, Bandits, An Army...
Players can assembled squads of their units and have to pick one of them to engage in Combat.

### Turning this into a roguelite

Somewhere on the map, the Demon King has spawned and is also expanding, though much faster and with stronger units than
the player.
Eventually, they will clash. The player can attempt to fight back, but that will become gradually harder over time,
given that the increased resistance will raise the big bad's attention.

In between runs, permanent upgrades can be purchased. Higher resource production, unit buffs, new unit classes,
increased distance to the demon spawn location... Maybe allow them to take a unit from their previous run with them.

If the player eventually manages to overcome and defeat the big bad, they have an option of becoming the big bad
themselves for their next run.

# Elevator Pitch

Hexagon Tactics is a tactical role playing game with roguelite elements. Players assemble squads of units and send them
into turn-based battles against AI controlled monsters. Defeating monsters will yield experience points and resources,
which can then be invested within the meta game for permanent upgrades.

It might be best described as a spiritual successor to Final Fantasy Tactics.

Aka "What should you play right now instead of waiting for this?"

#### Triangle Strategy – Square Enix, 2022 (PC / Nintendo Switch)

83/100 on Metacritic, User Score of 8.1, 79% Positive User Ratings on Steam

It was overall well received, but one of the main complaints players had is the huge amount of story and dialogues
taking place in between the actual battles. Hexagon Tactics would be the polar opposite here, focusing on battles with
little to no story in-between.

#### Final Fantasy Tactics – Square Enix, 1997 (PS1 / PSP / Mobile)

88/100 on Metacritic, User Score of 9.1, 4.1 Stars on Google Play Store.

To this day, both the original Final Fantasy Tactics and the PSP port Final Fantasy Tactics: War of the Lions are
regarded as the best Tactics Game out there by fans of the genre.

The game achieved a lot of tactical depth by allowing players to combine different classes, and it stroke a nice balance
between story drops and actual combat. The only downside was that leveling up new Units usually resulted in a lot of
grinding, since new skills where only learned by collecting experience points during battles with certain items
equipped.

Hexagon Tactics would borrow most of the combat and class system whilst simplifying the grind for levels and unlocking
new skills.

#### Fire Emblem: Three Houses – Nintendo, 2019 (Nintendo Switch)

89/100 on Metacritic, User Score of 8.8

### Look and Feel

Low-Poly 3D with low-resolution textures. Units and monsters might be represented with 2D sprites, akin to modern
games like Octopath Traveler or Triangle Strategy. To reduce the amount of spritework, this could be achieved by
rendering 3D Models from the 6 possible angles into spritesheets.

# MVP

The primary focus should be on the battle system until that's ironed out. To still get a basic gameplay loop going in
this state, in between battles players could get small random events and then the next battle starts, kinda like slay
the spire but without the map.

## MVP Game Loop

- Setup. At game start, the player gets to select their units. They'll always be shown two or three and have to pick one
  until they got a good amount.
- Combat. Once all units are chosen, the player gets thrown into a random combat encounter. If all their units die, it's
  game over.
- Rewards. If the player defeats all enemies, they'll receive some reward before getting thrown in the next combat
  encounter.

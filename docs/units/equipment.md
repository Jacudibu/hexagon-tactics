## Unit Equipment

Units can be equipped with items to directly change their stats. New equipment needs to either be crafted or looted
after battle. Some equipment might only be available to specific races.

### Weapons

Besides stat boosts, weapons will always come with a built-in skill that'll only be available while the weapon is
equipped. These skills may range from basic attacks to healing, all the way to powerful spells.

### Armor

Mostly boosting a unit's defensive stats.

### Accessory

Those may do a bit of everything - granting access to certain skills, boosting stats...

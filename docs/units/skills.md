# Skills

A new Skill is unlocked whenever a unit levels up or after purchasing an upgrade to unlock that skill for every unit of
the respective class.

Additionally, every weapon has a "weapon skill" assigned to them, which can only be used while that weapon is equipped.

## Roguelite Alternative

Which skills a unit learns on level up is randomized. Whenever a unit levels up, the player gets to pick between two
randomly selected skills.

### Some wacky Skill ideas

- Sacrifical Strike: Deal damage this round. Target heals twice the amount at the end of next turn.

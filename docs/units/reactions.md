### Reactions

Every Unit can have one Skill set as their Reaction. This will be triggered automatically whenever the condition is met,
but only once. It recharges at the end of their turn.

- Arrow Catcher: Dodge all incoming arrows.
- Retaliate: When attacked with a physical attack, retaliate with an attack of your own, if in range.
- Counterspell: When attacked with a spell, retaliate with a spell, if in range. (This can come in multiple variations
  for different spells, or the players can select which spell should be used.)
- Opportunity Attack: Whenever an enemy unit leaves your attack range, attack it.
- Quicken: When receiving damage, cast haste on yourself until the end of your next turn.
- Well Prepared: First hit in a fight receives damage bonus.
- Faster than Light: First direct hit in a fight will be evaded.

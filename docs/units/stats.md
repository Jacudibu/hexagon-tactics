## Stats

Let's use well-established D&D Style stats. Different classes will have their damage numbers be based on different
attributes, so these here are just rough ideas.

- Strength: How strong physical attacks are
- Dexterity: Unit Speed, Evasion Chance (Or just general damage reduction to avoid RNG)
- Constitution: Health pool and defense against physical attacks
- Intelligence: Damaging Magic, Magical Defense
- Wisdom: Healing Magic, Magical Defense

### Sub-Stats

- Health: 10 * Constitution
- Mana: Intelligence * X + Wisdom * X
- Speed: 50 + X * Dex
- Happiness: Flexible -15% to +15% stat boost depending on a variety of factors: Food, Housing, recent events...

(Mana is kinda necessary, to limit how many super-strong spells can be used in quick succession, especially with
multiclassing?)

## Classes

Every Class has a signature weapon assigned to them. Character classes can be changed at will, but stats are persistent
and raise depending on the active class on level up.

### Multiclassing

Every Unit can access the skills of one other class, but without access to their equipment. This means a black mage
could use white magic, or a warrior could use a lancer's skills. Thus, we don't necessarily need hybrid classes like
traditional red mages, players can just build those themselves, but still having them might be more interesting.

#### Melee-Focused Units

- Berserker: Axes. Strong focus on single target melee damage, can lower his defense to increase damage output.
- Fencer: Rapiers. Increased damage after getting hit.
- Knight: Swords. Well balanced defense & damage.
- Shieldbearer: Shields. Tanky support.

#### "Medium Armor", for a lack of a better term

- Rogue: Daggers. Fast moving, high damage glass cannons.
- Monk: Bracers. Physical based magic, mix of STR and WIS.
- Ranger: Bows. Can apply debuffs or boost damage by aiming at certain body parts.

#### Mages

- White Mage: Staves. Support. Heal focused.
- Black Mage: Wands. Magical Damage.
- Blood Mage: Claws. Instead of Mana, their spells use HP as a resource. Vampire-inspired.
- Summoner: Tomes. Summons monsters to fight for the player or deal heavy AoE damage.

## Classes

Every new Unit will have a class with level >= 1 assigned to them.

Character classes can be changed at will, but stats are persistent and raise depending on the active class on level up.
Certain classes might be locked behind specific character races, as might certain equipment.

### Multiclassing

Every Unit can access the skills of all their classes. This means a black mage could use white magic, or a warrior could
use an archer's skills, as long as they've learned those beforehand. Changing classes means starting at level 0: A unit
knows nothing about that class and has to figure it out first.

### Class Requirements

Some classes might require minimum stat requirements to be available, for example an intelligence threshold for an
advanced spellcaster class.

#### Melee-Focused Units

- Berserker: Axes. Strong focus on single target melee damage, can lower his defense to increase damage output.
- Fencer: Rapiers. Increased damage after getting hit.
- Knight: Swords. Well balanced defense & damage.
- Shieldbearer: Shields. Tanky support.

#### "Medium Armor", for a lack of a better term

- Rogue: Daggers. Fast moving, high damage glass cannons.
- Monk: Bracers. Physical based magic, mix of STR and WIS.
- Ranger: Bows. Can apply debuffs or boost damage by aiming at certain body parts.

#### Mages

- White Mage: Staves. Support. Heal focused.
- Black Mage: Wands. Magical Damage.
- Blood Mage: Claws. Instead of Mana, their spells use HP as a resource. Vampire-inspired.
- Summoner: Tomes. Summons monsters to fight for the player or deal heavy AoE damage.

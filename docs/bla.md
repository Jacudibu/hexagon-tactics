## Tiles and Tile Effects
- Grasslands: Food Production Bonus
- Woodlands: Timber Production Bonus
- Mountains: Metal Production Bonus

## Resources
- Quarters: Directly limit the army size. Every Unit occupies a spot, and when this is maxed out, no more units can be recruited
- Food: Needed to keep your population happy
- Money: Used to hire Mercenaries

# Combat
Battles take place on a hexagonal battlefield. Turn-Based, but one turn for each individual unit rather than for each player.

New combatants can either be trained (costing resources) or hired randomly after each encounter (costing money). Maybe the player can also attempt to tame wild monsters instead of defeating them.

## Classes 

### Skills
Skills are unlocked by purchasing them for resources.
For now, random wacky ideas go here:
- Sacrifical Dagger: Deal damage this round. Target heals twice the amount at the end of next turn.

### Reactions
Every Unit can have one Skill set as their Reaction. This will be triggered automatically whenever the condition is met.

- Arrow Catcher: Dodge all incoming arrows.
- Retaliate: When attacked with a physical attack, retaliate with an attack of your own.
- Counterspell: When attacked with a spell, retaliate with a spell. (This can come in multiple variations for different spells.)
- Opportunity Attack: Whenever an enemy unit leaves your attack range, attack it.
- Quicken: When receiving damage, cast haste on yourself until the end of your next turn.

### Multiclassing
Every Unit can have the skills of one other class, but without access to their equipment.

## Horoscopes
A random set of Units and/or Skills will receive Buffs and Debuffs every match. These effects will last for the entirety of the encounter.

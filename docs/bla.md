# Kingdom Building
- Hexagonal World Map
- Every Tile produces Resources
- Buildings can be placed onto Tiles to increase resource production or for other effects 
- Resources can be used to unlock new Skills, Equipment and Recruit new Fighters
- Player chooses one Tile to attack each round, which will initiate combat.
  - When victorious, tile will be conquered for the kingdom
- Likewise, owned Tiles will regularly be attacked by Monsters and other adversaries. 
  - Players can deploy units to defend their lands, or initiate a fight themselves.

-> Start from a small settlement to a globe-spanning empire!
- Tiles owned

## Resources
- Quarters: Directly limit the army size. Every Unit occupies a spot, and when this is maxed out, no more units can be recruited
- Food: Needed to keep your population happy
- Money: Used to hire Mercenaries

# Combat
Battles take place on a hexagonal battlefield. Turn-Based, but one turn for each individual unit rather than for each player.

New combatants can either be trained (costing resources) or hired randomly after each encounter (costing money)

## Classes 

### Skills
Skills are unlocked by unlocking and using equipment.
For now, random wacky ideas go here:
- Sacrifical Dagger: Deal damage this round. Target heals twice the amount at the end of next turn.

## Horoscopes
A random set of Units and/or Skills will receive Buffs and Debuffs every match. These effects will last for the entirety of the encounter.
